# EC349 Assignment 1: Analysis of Yelp Data

## Project Plan: Outline
1. Business and goal understanding
2. Analytic Approach
+ simple relationships between variables
+ clustering of variables
+ might have to go to data cleaning first and then come back again
3. Data requirements
4. Data preparation


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(jsonlite)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
getwd()
```

```{r Load data}
#Pre-Processing Yelp Academic Data for the Assignment
#Clear
cat("\014")  
rm(list=ls())

# Load Different Data
#business_data <- stream_in(file("../data/yelp_academic_dataset_business.json"))
#review_data  <- stream_in(file("../data/yelp_academic_dataset_review.json"))
#checkin_data  <- stream_in(file("../data/yelp_academic_dataset_checkin.json"))
#user_data <- stream_in(file("../data/yelp_academic_dataset_user.json"))
#tip_data  <- stream_in(file("../data/yelp_academic_dataset_tip.json"))

# Load smaller data sets for comparative purposes and easier testing
load("../data/yelp_review_small.Rda")
load("../data/yelp_user_small.Rda")

```

```{r Data exploration}
# data dimensions
#dim(business_data)
#dim(review_data)
#dim(checkin_data)
#dim(user_data)
#dim(tip_data)
dim(review_data_small)
dim(user_data_small)

```
### Data Description
+ data documentation: https://www.yelp.com/dataset/documentation/main
+ review_data: contains review_id, user_id, business_id, stars given to a business(0-5), useful (number of useful votes received), cool (number of cool votes received), funny (number of funny votes received)
+ business_data: location, avg. rating, number of reviews, open/ closed, attributes such as takeout and parking, category i.e. mexican, japanese etc., opening hours
+ user_data: name, friends, review count, number of useful, cool and funny votes **sent** by the user, number of different complements received by different users, avg number of stars given
+ checkin_data: time stamp of check ins made on a business
+ tip_data: comments of users to a particular business, number of compliments each comment received, mapped to user and business


## Methodology
This data science project requires a methodology that is iterative, intuitive and suitable for an individual project. Therefore, the CRISP-DM methodology is inappropriate given the large amount of documentation and stakeholder involvement included. Both, the SEMMA and OSEMN methods lack a phase dedicated to a clear problem definition. Despite it being an individual project outside a corporate setting, clearly defining the goal is crucial. Additionally, the TDSP and KDD methodologies are similar in structure to the John Rallin DS methodology, however, the latter is more detailed than the TDSP methodology. Thus, I will use an adapted version of the John Rallin general DS methodology. In particular, I will limit the first and last stages given the lack of a real-world setting which would require client and sponsor interaction as well as implementation.
