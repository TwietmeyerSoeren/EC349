#### Instruction:

1.  Create a R Markdown document
2.  Follow [this link](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) for
    help with basic R syntax OR copy and past this URL in your browser:
    <https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/>
3.  Follow [this
    link](https://markdownguide.offshoot.io/extended-syntax/#automatic-url-linking)
    to help with extended R syntax OR copy and past this URL in your
    browser:
    <https://markdownguide.offshoot.io/extended-syntax/#automatic-url-linking>
4.  Answer all questions.
5.  Write out each question and provide the solution immediately after
    using a title “**Answer**”.
    - You can copy the question directly from this document.
    - Be sure to provide an explanation of your code where relevant.
6.  Upload your Markdown file to your GitHub account.
7.  Provide the link to the GitHub document
8.  Convert your output to a PDF document and submit on Moodle.

Complete the following:

> 1.  Write your name and surname in bold font, with your Name ONLY in
>     italics.

**Sören** ***Twietmeyer***

> 2.  Print your student number and what year you are in on different
>     lines.

    Answer Below
```{r}
print("u238790")
```
u2138790 \
3rd year \

> 3.  Briefly state, in italics, why you are doing this Data Science
>     Module

    Answer Below
*I hope it was going to be a good addition to learn*

> 4.  Make an unordered list of at least 3 things you have learned in
>     this module.


### Heading 
    Answer Below
1. A    
4. B    
3. C    
This still returns an ordered list even if you select a wrong order

+ A   
+ B   
+ C   


> 5.  Create a table showing the 1st 5 stages of the John Rollins
>     General Data Science Methodology and the quetions associate with
>     them.

    Answer Below
```{r}

table(c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E"), c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5))
```
|S/N|Name|Surname|
|:----|:----|:----|
|1.|Tom|Hardy|
|2.|Tom|Cruise|
: lets you specify the justification

> 6.  Create an ordered list of at least 3 other Data Science
>     methodologies.

    Answer Below

> 7.  Provide and ordered list the weaknesses of the CRISP-DM
>     methodology and how to address them

    Answer Below

> 8.  Download and include a University of Warwick Logo in your
>     document.

> 9.  Write and execute a code to randomly generate 10 numbers from a
>     normal distribution with mean 12 and standard deviation 3.

    Answer Below
rnorm(10, 12, 3)

> 10. Write and execute a code to calculate the mean of 12 random
>     numbers generated from the intervalof integes from 5 to 25.

    Answer Below

> 11. Write and execute a code to create a scatter plot containing 12
>     points whose coordinates were randomly geenrated in the interval 5
>     to 25. Provide a title for the figure, label the x and y axis.

    Answer Below

> 12. Write and execute a code to create a function to calculate
>     standard error. Then, calculate the standard error of a set of 15
>     randomly generated numbers from a normal distribution with mean 12
>     and standard deviation 3.

    Answer Below

> 13. Given that BMI=kg/m2, where kg is the person’s weight in kilograms
>     and m2is height in meters squared, write and execute a code to
>     create a function that calculates the BMI of who weighs 85kg and
>     is 1.9m tall.

    Answer Below


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
df <- data.frame(abc = 1, xyz = "a")
df$x
df[, "xyz"]
df[, c("abc", "xyz")]


annoying <- tibble(
  `1` = 1:10,
  `2` = `1` * 2 + rnorm(length(`1`))
)
annoying$`2`
ggplot(annoying, aes(`1`, `2`)) + geom_point() + xlab("X Axis") + ylab("Y Axis")


```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
mtcars$disp
test_tibble <- as_tibble(mtcars)
test_tibble <- test_tibble %>% rename("weight" = "wt")
ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg)) + geom_point() + xlab("Weight") + ylab("Miles per gallon") + ggtitle("Weight and Miles per gallon of cars", subtitle = "Test")

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
